Hotchop and mah 2025 Playsaurus Game Jam Project

So we’re going for Heavenly Miracle Hotline, but instead of generic angels, it’s staffed by a chaotic pantheon of minor Greek gods — all the forgotten or overly specific deities who’ve been repurposed into call center agents for modern prayers.

⚡ Heavenly Miracle Hotline (Greek God Edition)
🏛 Premise
Mount Olympus has gone corporate. After centuries of declining worship, the gods had to “pivot.” Now they operate Heavenly Miracle Hotline — a divine customer support line for mortals’ prayers.
Humans now send their prayers through a call center system — and you’re the poor manager stuck assigning random minor gods to handle the most ridiculous requests:
“Please make my ex jealous.”
“Fix my Wi-Fi connection.”
“Help my cat understand boundaries.”
“Please fix my crush’s Wi-Fi so we can talk again”
You have a roster of quirky, petty gods — divine beings of absurdly specific domains like “The God of Fresh Laundry,” “The Goddess of Unread Emails,” minor gods like Acraphius, God of Forgotten Passwords or Euphonia, Muse of Karaoke Triumphs.
Your goal? Keep Faith levels up, appease your gods’ egos, and avoid another PR disaster like the “Mass Frog Plague of ’23.” Start as a bottom rung and rise up to be an Executive of Olympus!

⚙️ Gameplay Loop
